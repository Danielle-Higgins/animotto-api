Are you building an application and want access to quotes from your favorite anime characters? Then use AniMotto, a free API that doesn't require an account, an API key, or payment information (also it's not blocked by CORS which is a plus ðŸ˜‰). You can make API requests to AniMotto in which it will respond with a random quote from various anime. You can also recieve a random quote based on the anime or the character that you want it to be from!

This API is built using Node.JS with the Express.JS framework. The server file will handle requests coming in from the client based on the routes it's making requests to. When making a request to the main route, the index page will display which is the documentation to the API. The documentation will tell the user how to use the API and about the different endpoints that are available. If you want more information, check out the documentation! All the static files are located within the public folder and as of right now, and the data in the data folder which will be eventually transferred into a database.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would like to include the sidebar onto smaller screens and transfer the data into a database. I would also like to include more data and endpoints as well.

## Lessons Learned

I learned to build an API, how to include a favicon inside of the browser tab, and how to include code snippets using pre/code tags and use highlight JS to highlight the code.
